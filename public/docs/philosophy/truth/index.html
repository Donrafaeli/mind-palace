  Truth
  <a class="anchor" href="#truth">#</a>
</h1>
<p>Honestly, I can&rsquo;t fucking believe I&rsquo;m even attempting to write this.</p>
<p>When drilling into deep ideas, most of my thought processes after a while usually hit bedrock. How do I know anything is True? How am I to think about ideas and communicate those thoughts if I don&rsquo;t have a solid reference point. It seems like this is a subset of the question of how do I know if anything is real?</p>
<p>My current feeling, informed by Joschua Bach is that there is only one objective material truth - &ldquo;There is an absolute truth in the realisation that something seems to be happening.&rdquo; And currently, that&rsquo;s as much as I&rsquo;m willing to dogmatically state.</p>
<p>However bizzarely tongue in cheek this is, any other rock that I grab onto seems to be relative to something else, the relativity continuing, as they say, all the way down.</p>
<p>I think this is because objective thinking is something really foreign to our brains, and ultimately something with limited, or even miniscule, evolutionary utility. (Yes, even I tire of the constant returns to the bioevolutionary. But you have to constantly return to those handful of things you feel that are true, and reexamine them. That way, you don&rsquo;t stray too far into unfounded thought loops.)</p>
<p>As you quickly learn while working in IT, the ideal does not exist, you only have &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;. You can&rsquo;t write the ideal app and then ship, you must make do with good enough and quickly iterate. And that&rsquo;s what brains do best. Quick value judgements, condensing the infinite complexity of the world into simple action - look over there, don&rsquo;t eat that, don&rsquo;t trust that person.</p>
<p>So, it seems that</p>
<p>Questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How do I live a good life?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do I know if I&rsquo;m using the same word as someone else for the same thing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the concept of self more useful than it is imprisoning, and as such, do I even want to dissolve it?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>most times end up in the same dead-end alley that I&rsquo;ve come to know so well.</p>
<p>And even though I know that many (and I mean Many) more observant people looked around for an exit; in my young and rash foolishness, I will now look at it with fresh eyes and try to  find a hole to squeeze through, even if it was only big enough for me.</p>

  Finding Truth
  <a class="anchor" href="#finding-truth">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I have a strong hunch that this will be a slippery problem without a satisfiying answer. It will most likely involve conceding that there&rsquo;s no getting around the <strong>Filter</strong>, which I still feel is correct.  And ultimately, even after admitting the rash foolishness of the whole thing, It still feels pointless to look without the help of a body of literature. As i&rsquo;m currently writing this in the present, without such a body of research behind me, I can only be guided by my intuitions and hope that they won&rsquo;t lead me through an unending labyrinth of navel-gazing.</p>
<h2 id="why-would-i-want-that-anyway">
  Why would I want that anyway?
  <a class="anchor" href="#why-would-i-want-that-anyway">#</a>
</h2>
<p>It hit me just now, why do I even assume truth is a good thing?</p>
<p>Hmm let&rsquo;s see. A primary function would probably be adaptational. If we say that truth is something most alligned with reality, then we can assume that thinking and acting in such a way would maximize our environmental adaptability, preventing us from &ldquo;acting more stupidly then we absolutely must&rdquo;. Simple, if you know facts about the environment, you can traverse it better. And if we&rsquo;re going to debate whether falling down a ravine is better than passing around it to reach the mountaintop, It&rsquo;s going to be a long night.</p>
<p>So okay, basic facts about the world are good to know and not knowing them is patently bad for you, so truth in this mechanical sense is a good thing. That wasn&rsquo;t so difficult to prove.</p>
<p>But, even before putting my mind probe in this other gumbo, I know that the reality of truth is probably more similar to our current physics model of classical and quantum states. That is to say, if you look at the big picture, one answer is apparent, whereas if you look at the interpersonal level and inside the brain, things start getting less certain and more probabilistic - you discover that if you zoom into a white issue, it&rsquo;s actually made out of a whole grey spectrum array.</p>
<p>This is similar to the Coastline paradox or Gabriel&rsquo;s horn type problem - the finer scale you use to measure, the more the measurement approaches infinity. Maybe a weird analogy, will have to check if this makes sense.</p>
<h2 id="working-theory">
  Working theory
  <a class="anchor" href="#working-theory">#</a>
</h2>
<p>small t true - acting in accordance with it holds an environmental advantage. If you act in that way, it aligns you better with small r reality - human-social scale, increases environmental fitness.</p>
<p>This is altruistic as well as egoistic - here we get human values - humility, honesty, honor, benevolence</p>
<p>capital T True - quantum graph level, para-human, untouchable, seemingly meaningless and probably inaccessible.</p>
