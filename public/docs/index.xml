      <description>About#This is a static site, built with Hugo and self-hosted. I wanted to have a crack at doing a full stack project from home with little prior knowledge and experience. So far, the experience has been like trying to make a hole in the wall using your forehead and actually succeeding. Feels pretty amazing in the end, but it makes my head hurt in the process.
Making#Everything you see here is markdown written in VSCode and Typora, built by Hugo.</description>

      <description>Server setup#Hardware#Todo#Buy HDD - 256 GBish, preferrably m.2 with a SATA adapter, for future proofing
Check processor - possibly upgrade with 3rd gen low power xeon from nju≈°kalo
Check proc cooler clearance and available space, then put the biggest quietest one in with a huge pwm fan
Check if cooling is doable just with the beefy proc cooler for airflow - it should be since there are no other heat critical components</description>
