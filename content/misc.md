# Server setup

## Hardware  

### Todo  

Buy HDD - 356 GBish, preferrably m.2 with a SATA adapter, for future proofing 

Check processor - possibly upgrade with 3rd gen low power xeon from nju≈°kalo  

Check proc cooler clearance and available space, then put the biggest quietest one in with a huge pwm fan  

Check if cooling is doable just with the beefy proc cooler for airflow - it should be since there are no other heat critical components    

  

CPU cooler choices:
