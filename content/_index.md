>Currently, the scaffolds are up, and all the thoughts expressed here are in nascency. I expect at least 50 man hours before it looks and reads presentably. So if you somehow managed to stumble upon this - congrats, you are a smart little weasel. Feel free to shot me an email if you have any thoughts.


# Mind Palace

Less digital garden more excuse for a full stack web development project.
An attempt to clear and organize thought patterns and recombine them in interesting ways.  
A navel-gazing wiki.

## Proclamation

The intended use for :european_castle: Mind Palace is thus:

+ Develop my writing [ writing = thinking ]
+ Put some restless mind patterns on calm paper
+ Discover new facets of my personality
+ Come to peace with psychological trauma by mulching it through writing
+ Seek out novel ways to drag myself by the nuts out of a rut and into living life
+ Figure out what's halting my personal developement and devise growth tactics
