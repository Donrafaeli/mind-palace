>Currently, the scaffolds are up, and the context and content are under construction. I&nbsp;expect at least 43 more productive hours in dev and as much in writing before it's good to show to someone. So if you somehow managed to stumble here before then - congrats, you are a smart little weasel. Feel free to shot me an email if you have any thoughts.


# Mind Palace

Less digital garden more excuse for a full stack web development project.
An attempt to organize thought patterns and recombine them in interesting ways.  
A navel-gazing wiki.
