# Mind Palace

Less online garden and more excuse for a full stack web development project.
An attempt to clear and organize thought patterns and recombine them in interesting ways.

## Proclamation

The intended use for my :european_castle: Mind Palace is thus:

+ Develop my writing [ writing = thinking ]
+ Put some restless mind patterns on calm paper
+ Discover new facets of my personality
+ Come to peace with psychological trauma by mulching it through writing
+ Seek out novel ways to kick myself in the nuts out of a rut and into living life
+ Hone some philosophical ideas about life that are quietly brewing
+ Figure out what's halting my personal developement and devise growth tactics

From these goals, general areas of interest form:

## Themes

## 1. Life
## 1. Philosophy
## 1. Autopsychiatry
