# Boomerang ideas



are, as you would think, ideas that you constantly return to, more accurately that return to you.

For me, it's just common patterns that reappear in my thoughts, often general in nature. As a heuristic, I use that reappearance to mean that my pattern recognition is noticing something interesting, and that they are therefore useful to think about. [^1]

I use thinking time to mull over the ideas and see if they make sense intrinsically. This is opposite from a research stage of information foraging, it's a time when I weed out incorrect ideas and connect the updated useful ones in an multi-domain web. It is usually during moderate physical activity - walking, rollerblading, or biking. Shoveling and chopping wood also work. No music allowed. This usually has the effect of focusing my attention, as the body is occupied by some arbitrary motion, the blood flows, and the mind is left to its own. The process is entirely unforced and optional, I allow myself to be empty and then something maybe comes out. Sometimes just empty is more than fine.

The above may all sound grandiose, but in essence it's a playful process of entertaining ideas and playing out various outcomes of "what if this were true". The more the simulated world looks and acts like the real one, the stronger my feeling is that I am on to something.



## Interpersonal 

- Male-female psychological differences

- What makes males attractive to females and vice- versa

- Friends as the ultimate inter-human connection (Torre)



## Concrete life stuff

- How to find the balance between control and letting go

- How to stop caring about people's opinions

- Rut vs disorganization

  

## Philosophical / Aetheric

- What does it mean to live a good life
- Is there such a thing as truth
- How to know if two people are using the same word to mean the same thing 



- How do I not become bitter with myself and life
- Is it inherently better to live a full, strong life





[^1]: I am, of course aware that when I recognise some general pattern, it is equally a reflection of the external world state and my **filter**, but as far as I know, the fact that being subjective is as much a part of being human as being wet is a part of water. So a core presupposition that I make is that there is no getting around the filter, only cleaning and examining it.
