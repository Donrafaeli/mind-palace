## Todo

### Blocking

+ find a way to set minimum visible post length, or disable it completely
+ fix footnote symbol and text colors to fit dark theme
+ implement images and see how they fit with the dark theme - small border? - caddy?

### Iteration

+ see if serving fonts from a CDN is better
+ is auto-linting md files a thing?
+ dark/light mode switch, like in hugo code theme
+ set caching policy and the rest of the good stuff
+ do actual favicons - optimize for speed- noobody's going to see this in a fricking app store

## Doing

+ turn "thought bites" into short diary style idea entries

## Done

+ fix the expand shortcode not switching between open and closed icons
+ fix mobile layout of body text
+ fix fontawesome icons in the expand shortcode
+ fix incorrect MIME type error for FA library (possibly related to above)
+ figure out what's up with loinks to the js library - how to load them properly in a local environment
+ make the expand shortcode work
+ see if that IPV6 tunnel is actually necessary (probably not)
+ see why www. does not redirect properly
+ purge the server of unneccesary scripts and packages related to dynamic dns
+ see if i can setup cloudflare with dyn dns
+ setup ssl with letsencrypt -> see what the heck is with those AAAA records  
+ Everything else :)
