## Todo

### Blocking



### Iteration

+ research and test most optimal image format and compression algo - JPEG, JPEG XL or WEBP? - <https://martijnvanvreeden.nl/hugo-shortcode-to-serve-images-in-next-gen-formats/>
+ see if serving fonts from a CDN is better
+ is auto-linting md files a thing?
+ dark/light mode switch, like in hugo code theme
+ set caching policy and the rest of the good stuff
+ do actual favicons - optimize for speed- noobody's going to see this in a fricking app store
+ double check this guide - <https://martijnvanvreeden.nl/10-ways-to-improve-your-hugo-website-performance/>
+ is switching to Caddy worth it? Current answer - no

## Doing

## Done

+ find a way to set minimum visible post length, or disable it completely
+ turn "thought bites" into short diary style idea entries
+ What's up with the image not changing in about section?
+ implement image theme and see how it fits with the dark theme - small border?
+ fix footnote symbol and text colors to fit dark theme
+ working images (this should not have taken that long)
+ the expand shortcode not switching between open and closed icons
+ mobile layout of body text
+ fontawesome icons in the expand shortcode
+ incorrect MIME type error for FA library (possibly related to above)
+ figure out what's up with loinks to the js library - how to load them properly in a local environment
+ make the expand shortcode work
+ see if that IPV6 tunnel is actually necessary (probably not)
+ see why www. does not redirect properly
+ purge the server of unneccesary scripts and packages related to dynamic dns
+ see if i can setup cloudflare with dyn dns
+ setup ssl with letsencrypt -> see what the heck is with those AAAA records  
+ Everything else :)
