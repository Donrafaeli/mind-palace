## About  
This is a static site, built with Hugo and self-hosted. I wanted to have a crack at doing a full stack project from home with little prior knowledge and experience. So far has been way more than rewarding.

## Making

Everything you see here is markdown written in VSCode and Typora, built by Hugo. The theme I'm running is a modified version of the Hugo "book" theme.  
  
## Building

I work locally, then push to a public github repo, pull to my server and generate the site there.  

## Serving

Hosting is handled locally on a little server called "Kantica" - it means "little bucket". It cosily runs under the desk in my bedroom, concurrently hosting a small minecraft server.The site is served with Nginx.
