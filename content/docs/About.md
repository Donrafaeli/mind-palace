## About  
I am Rafael.  
I'm still figuring out what this little space is for.  
Let me explain what this IS, that's easy.

&nbsp;

This is a static website, built with Hugo and self-hosted. I wanted to have a crack at doing a full stack project from home with little prior knowledge and experience. So far, the experience has been like trying to make a hole in the wall using your forehead and actually succeeding. Feels pretty amazing in the end, but it makes my head hurt in the process.

## Making

Everything you see here is markdown written in VSCode and Typora, built by Hugo. The theme I'm running is a modified version of the Hugo "book" theme.  
  
## Building

I work locally, then push to a public github repo, pull to my server and generate the site there.  

## Serving

The site is served with Nginx, but I'm contemplating switching to Caddy. Hosting is handled locally on a little server called "Kantica" - it means "little bucket". It cosily runs under the desk in my bedroom, concurrently hosting a small minecraft server. All server-side stuff is done through SSH from my laptop running Terminus.  
  
## Terminal  

Terminus, despite being a dreaded Electron app, actually works quite nice for my needs. I do not spend my days in a CLI, so sub 50ms reaction time is not first on my priority list. I gladly trade  it for the simplest SSH UX around, lotsa customization and an oh so sweet see through window. I know i know, sue me. Also, apart from ideological reasons, I have no issue with my terminal eating 130MB of my RAM. Combine the thing with ohmyzsh and it's even better.

## Hardware
