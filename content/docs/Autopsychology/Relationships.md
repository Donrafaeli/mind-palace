# Relationships

Ohhh boyo, here we go.  
  
  Well, this whole project basically began as a way for me to process my still very fresh breakup. So as you may imagine, there is ground to tread here and we will tread it intuitively - pulling themes and **my emotions** like threads, tugging on each one and seeing what unravels. As you might assume, I will mostly be doing the unraveling, but also the unraveling. Dive with me.  
    
I have a possibly controversial opinion about relationships. It's more of a feeling than an opinion, lying sort of unrealized and unthought through.  
0m not too familiar with the literature regarding love and attachement. I've dabbled in attachement theory and I feel it rings true. It's one of those depressing truths though, as it seems mostly crystallized in youth.    

However, not letting the self-fulfilling prophecy fulfill, I will take the optimistic approach of early neuroplasticity pioneers and put it to the side with a bookmark.  
  
  I digress. The feeling is that I always seem to love one person.  More accurately, I feel love for the person I am with, but it seems that the external things that influence that feeling (their presence, behavior etc) are merely triggers for me to trigger an internal feeling, a familiar feeling. No matter the person I am with, that feeling is almost always the same.  I love each of my partners in the same way.  
    
My writing time for today is running out, but for next time, let me continue with my feeling that that fact is influenced by the love you feel from your mother and the relationship between your parents. But your intrinsic level of neuroticism and uncertainty (a subset of your attachement style) and the love you "learn" from your parent of the opposite sex seem to be the biggest influence. I know it's super weird to compare a motherly love to the one towoards your intimate partner, but I always figured there was some kind of connection there.  Also try to figure out if "mommy issues" and "daddy issues" fit nicely in this argument.  
  
**(once the argument is made and thought is trimmed down)**
  
In the same way, I think that the feelings I now feel towards my ex are not really about her.  
It's easy to think that since she is the only obvious trigger of negative feelings - seeing her in town, getting a message from her...
But the real source of the feelings is my own inner concept of girlfriend - the meta-girlfriend.  
That's why it hurts even though my particular ex did nothing major or egregious to harm me - just a nice civil breakup.  
But every time the feelings trigger, it's the meta-gf rejecting me and it's her leaving.  
Makes sense, right?
