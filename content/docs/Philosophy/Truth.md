# Truth

Honestly, I can't fucking believe I'm even attempting to write this.

When drilling into deep ideas, most of my thought processes after a while usually hit bedrock. How do I know anything is True, and if something is, how to conceptualize Truth to be most in line with thinking and acting in the world?

Questions such as:

- How do I live a good life?

- How do I know if I'm using the same word as someone else for the same thing?

- Is the concept of self more useful than it is imprisoning, and as such, do I even want to dissolve it?

most times end up in the same dead-end alley that I've come to know so well.  

And even though I know that many (and I mean Many) more observant people looked around for an exit; in my young and rash foolishness, I will now look at it with fresh eyes and try to  find a hole to squeeze through, even if it was only big enough for me.

## Finding Truth

I have a strong hunch that this will be a slippery problem without a satisfiying answer. It will most likely involve conceding that there's no getting around the **Filter**, which I still feel is correct.
