# The Filter

The objective world doesn't exist. At least not as far as humans are concerned. After all, objectivity is an Ideal - a goal set beyond reach so that we may proverbially shoot for the stars and land on the moon.  

That does not mean that it is useless to aim for objectivity - quite the opposite. It just means that we have to stay open minded and doubtful, always.  

In this context, I present the idea of the Filter. We each have a glass through which we view the world[^1]. Instead of ignoring it, and blindly believing ourselves correct, he only thing we can do is to periodically look at the glass instead of through it, see where it is dirty and attempt to clean it. Even being aware of the dirty spots in our thought patterns can help us distinguish them from actual objects "out there".

To rewrite this better, listen to this again

"Physical reality is a weird quantum graph that we can never experience or get access to. But it has these properties that it can create systemic patterns in our interface to the world. And we make sense of these patterns, and the relationships between them is what we call the physical universe."

"There is an absolute truth in the realisation that something seems to be happening. "

[^1]: As Neitzsche puts forward in *Beyond Good and Evil*: But this is an old and everlasting story:  what happened in old times with the Stoics still happens today, as soon  as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always creates the  world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this  tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual Will to Power, the will to ‘creation of the world,’ the will to the causa prima.
