# Pragmatism vs Buddhism

Religions and philosophical traditions seem to me like distributed computers trying to calculate the answer to the question of **How to live a better life.**

Myself being interested in that subject, I often tackle its various facets with thinking tools - mental models picked up and culled throughout the years of mutual evolutionary combat.  

## Desire and freedom

One of the thought-lines i often come back to is something I got from Alan Watts' "The Wisdom of Insecurity". It posits that the desire for something and the freedom from wanting it are inversely correlated.  

So the more I wish to be strong and fit, the waker and unfit I actually feel. 
The greater the desire, the greater the underlying feeling of not having it.
This oversimplification of how emotion and behaviour is driven points at the dualistic and conflicting nature of desire.

We wish something because we do not have it  
**The realisation always feels obtusely straightforward, but deep truths always have a truistic twang.[^1]**  

This prompts a call to insecurity and being okay with yourself, just as you are in the present moment. In short - acceptance. Damn, the Buddhists did have it all along.

I always try to remember that the insecure behavior seems like a good adaptation.  
From an evolutionary perspective, it's beneficial to always be dissatisfied. The future is uncertain and more fitness, security and food is always a good thing - if a dire situation arises, you have to be ready.  

This argument can be applied to many areas relating to human happiness. We are simply not optimized to be happy as an individual, we are optimized to survive and reproduce. This obsession with Happiness seems to me like the pinnacle of the hedonic hierarchy. You want to satisfy your subsistems in the best way for as long as possible.




## Nothing in excess

The realisation on the nature of desire immediately opened a new round of questions, which is where I am stuck now. It's the balance of control vs letting go.

I have a sudden feeling that Buddhists have it right with the idea of Yin and Yang, something Jordan Peterson explored more in his book "Maps of meaning". The image of the middle path - one leg drenched in chaos and other rooted in order seems like an imagistic answer to my question of control vs letting go. You need both, and it's always context-specific. It actually makes sense that such an old truth would resolve so non-specifically. Its popularity shows that it's a multi-domain truth that encompasses all of human activity. That's a huge bubble. For something that applies to every human now living and every one that ever lived and will live, it must be non-specific by definition.
