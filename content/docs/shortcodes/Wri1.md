# Writing Style

One of my interests, that relates particularily to this venture, is writing clearly.

I have not done much work in this area, and I'm prepared for my attempts to sound ridiculous, but I feel I have a good starting point.  

Since it's one of my **common themes**, I think about it often, ironically rarely putting anything to paper. One of my cristallization moments came from watching a talk by Steven Pinker titled [Linguistics, Style and Writing in the 21st Century][L1].[^1] The guy practically read my mind in regards to writing style, and level-mindledly hacked away most tenants of academic and wannabe academic writing, leaving just common sense.   

A feeling came over me, one I remember feeling before, after reading ["Design for the real world"][L2].  It's as if everyone was delusional, and one guy just shouted - *the king is naked!* Everyone was consciously writing unclearly, just to appear professional and at the same time pushing away most onlookers because the texts were riddled with 50% filler. Or, even worse - attracting more readers, because the text was hermetic and people love to look smarter than they are. I should know how it feels to produce that kind of writing, I did it for my [Master's thesis][L3]. 





[^1]: Writing this reminds me that I have no idea how capitalization works in English. Even constantly capitalizing "I" makes me shudder slightly.
